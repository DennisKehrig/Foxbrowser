{"body":"## Firefox Home for iPad\r\nFoxbrowser is an attempt to upgrade Mozilla's Firefox Home iOS app with an shiny new iPad UI and provide a better browsing experience. \r\n\r\nThis hobby-project of me started as a fork of [Firefox Home](http://hg.mozilla.org/services/fx-home/). I replaced the entire user interface and designed a new one with tabs and everything else you would expect.\r\n\r\n#### Features\r\n- Safari style UI (Might change in future releases)\r\n- Support for Firefox Sync as in Firefox Home (Open tabs, Bookmarks & History)\r\n- Secure end to end encrypted transport of your Sync data\r\n- Up to 8 Tab's\r\n- Start screen with the most frequent visited History entry's\r\n- See open tabs from your other Firefox Sync enabled devices\r\n- Real-time search in your browsing history, bookmarks and tabs\r\n- Send Tweet's and mail's directly from the App\r\n- Best of all: It's free (Apache Licence)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sync support limitations\r\nCurrently there is support for syncing your bookmarks, history and tabs to your iPad.\r\nDue to limitations in the Mozilla Weave sync provider, there is no support for saving bookmarks.\r\nThis will be fixed in the future.\r\n\r\n![Logo](https://raw.github.com/graetzer/Foxbrowser/master/iTunesArtwork.png)\r\n","google":"UA-33875972-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
