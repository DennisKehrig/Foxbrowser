I replaced the entire user interface and designed a new one with tabs and everything else you would expect from a browser.\r\n\r\n#### Features\r\n- Safari style UI (Might change in future releases)\r\n- Support for Firefox Sync as in Firefox Home (Open tabs, Bookmarks & History)\r\n- Secure end to end encrypted transport of your Sync data\r\n- Up to 8 Tab's\r\n- Start screen with the most frequent visited History entry's\r\n- See open tabs from your other Firefox Sync enabled devices\r\n- Real-time search in your browsing history, bookmarks and tabs\r\n- Send Tweet's and mail's directly from the App\r\n- Support for Http Auth (Basic and Digest)\r\n- Best of all: It's free (Apache Licence)\r\n\r\n### Sync support limitations\r\nDue to limitations in the Mozilla Weave sync provider, there is no support for saving bookmarks.\r\nTabs and history are not synced upstream to your other devices.\r\n\r\n### Future development\r\nI'm hoping that Mozilla is going to extend their support for iOS based devices and I would like to contribute to an official Firefox for iOS. As far as I know they are working on an experimental iOS project named Mozilla Junior. As soon as they release some results I should be able to replace the old Firefox Home Sync code and provide two-way sync\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 1](http://graetzer.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/foxbrowser_screen1.png)\r\n![Screenshot 1](http://graetzer.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/foxbrowser_screen2.png)\r\n\r\n![Logo](https://raw.github.com/graetzer/Foxbrowser/master/Weave/Images/logo@2x.png)\r\n","name":"Foxbrowser"}
